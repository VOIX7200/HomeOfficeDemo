##Things that I would like to improve with the current test.

1. There is one absolute Xpath in GoogleSearchPage which I would like to make relative

2. I would also like to chain the pages in the test flow.

3. I was also going to set up cross browser test runs

4. The day i submitted the test, the search suddenly start returning 5 elements instead of 10
   and i wanted to trouble shoot that.
   
5. I would like to add Logging using Log4J

Note: Do these and add to new Git Hub
